# Infra

Describes (and eventually builds) my home service infrastructure.

> * Much of my service-specific config is in private repositories and needs
>   to be migrated. I'm not sure yet how I'll organize that config going forward; perhaps
>   it will all be in this repo? Maybe sub-repos?
>
> * I'm optimizing for speed in writing the first pass. I need to fill in details like
>   model numbers, complete specs, etc. later.
>
> * What information should be published and what should be withheld?
>
> * Create doc structure so storage pools can each have their own page.
