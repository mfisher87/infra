Our tower-style UPS is undersized. I have my servers in rackmountable cases, so I feel I
should get a rackmountable UPS and a rack at this point.


## TODO

- [x] Buy a rackmount UPS with spare capacity (the current UPS probably is undersized)
- [x] Buy a rack (and rails?)
- [x] Rack mount UPS
- [ ] Rack mount servers
