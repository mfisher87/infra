:::

Tower-style UPS is undersized. I have my servers in rackmountable cases, so I feel I
should get a rackmountable UPS and a rack at this point.


## TODO

- [ ] Buy a rackmount UPS with spare capacity (the current UPS probably is undersized)
  - [ ] Buy a rack (and rails?)
  - [ ] Rack mount servers and UPS
